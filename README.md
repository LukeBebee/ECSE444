# ECSE444
Repository for ECSE444 W23 Group 22 Labs (McGill University)

These projects are meant for the B-L4S5I-IOT01A Discovery Kit by ST Microelectronics and the STM32CubeIDE, STM32CubeMX, and ST-Link Server Software. Code is written in C and ARM Assembly.

Note: Lab 1 content is in folder "Lab", do not change this as it will mess up the build path. The project name is still Lab 1 and should be usable without this being a major concern.
